=== TODO

* support iotivity logging for the jni bits called by stack, e.g. the
  OCEntityHandler service routine.  needed so we can log errors since
  we cannot throw java exceptions for that sort of error.

* subclass LinkedList and HashMap so we can use them to add and remove items

* cache field ids

* memory leakage:  DeleteLocalRef, etc.

== react

* "registration" of responses to discovery requests
* 

== retrieve/discover

* notes on difference
** no DISCOVER method
** discovery is just RETRIEVE, either multicast or unicast
** unicast discover is same as GET on a resource
** difference is some URIs are special (/oic/p, etc.) in that they can be read without DTLS
** implications for reaction to response

== renaming


Fix:  ObservationRecord.PLATFORM -> ??


ObservationOut  =>  removed, implicit in exhibitBehavior

ObservationIn =>  Behavior

StimulusOut => removed, implicity in exhibitStimulus

StimulusIn => Stimulus

ObservationRecord => Observation?  Stimulii and Behaviors contain Observations?

== multithreading

* call "init" (or "thread") method first thing in new thread in order
  to intialize TLS?
* jni multithreading and JVM
** (*env)->MonitorEnter(obj), (*env)->MonitorExit(obj)
* memory leaks
** _finally_ blocks?
** free jni strings
* thread_local
** does not compile on OS X, but _Thread_local does
** use pthread_key_create etc. instead of C11's thread_local?

* exception checking:

[source,c]
----
    if ((*env)->ExceptionCheck(env)) {
	(*env)->ExceptionDescribe(env);
    }
----

* general checklist: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jni/

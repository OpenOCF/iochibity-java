= java wrapper on c api

== naming conventions


JNI:

* 'klass' is reserved for the jclass arg (Class object) of static methods
* 'this' is reserved for the (this) jobject arg of object methods
* k_  is the prefix used for klasses other than the klass object
* fid_ is the prefix for field ids from GetFieldId, e.g. fid_class_method
* mid_ is the prefix for method ids from GetMethodId, e.g. mid_class_method
* mids_ is for static methods
* j_ - prefix for java objects
* c_ - prefix for native c data

UPPER_CASE prefixes: file scope, for caching; e.g. K_PAYLOAD.


Java:

* _ - underscore prefix marks a field as both private and
  corresponding to an underlying var, ptr, struct, e.g. _handle


== exceptions

Instead of returning an OCStackResult code we return void and throw
Java exceptions as needed.


=== TODO

* support iotivity logging for the jni bits called by stack, e.g. the
  OCEntityHandler service routine.  needed so we can log errors since
  we cannot throw java exceptions for that sort of error.

* subclass LinkedList and HashMap so we can use them to add and remove items

* cache field ids

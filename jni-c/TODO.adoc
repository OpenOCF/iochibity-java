=== TODO

* support iotivity logging for the jni bits called by stack, e.g. the
  OCEntityHandler service routine.  needed so we can log errors since
  we cannot throw java exceptions for that sort of error.

* subclass LinkedList and HashMap so we can use them to add and remove items

* cache field ids

* memory leakage:  DeleteLocalRef, etc.

== renaming


Fix:  ObservationRecord.PLATFORM -> ??


ObservationOut  =>  removed, implicit in exhibitBehavior

ObservationIn =>  Behavior

StimulusOut => removed, implicity in exhibitStimulus

StimulusIn => Stimulus

ObservationRecord => Observation?  Stimulii and Behaviors contain Observations?

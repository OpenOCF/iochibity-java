== observation

To observe an external stimulus is to:

* "accept" or "receive" it
* integrate its information into one's internal state

So by the time control is passed to e.g. a CoSP's `coreact` method,
the observation data is already integrated into the CoSP's internal
state.  The react method thus does not react to something external
(passed as an arg); it's really just a means of allowing the user to
do additional reacting on the observed data.

Ditto on the server side: the observed data (i.e. request message) is
already integrated into the SP's internal state by the time control is
passed to its `react` method.

We can do this down in the protocol stack because the process is
always the same.

Advantage: no need to present abstractions of implementation details
like "request message" or "response message", "payload", etc.  We just
need a model of internal state that accomodates the necessary
information in the most convenient manner possible.

namespace structure:

openocf.app - application-level stuff: resources and coresources

openocf.signals - symmetric messaging data: StimulusIn, StimulusOut, etc.

openocf.engine - services provided by the engine to application and peer code

openocf.ocfresources - OCF-defined application resources, i.e. device, platform, svrs

alternatively:  openocf.device, openocf.platform, openocf.svrs?



DeviceAddress - should be a field in a device abstraction? or a utils/Address.java?

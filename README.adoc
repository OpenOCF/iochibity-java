Java API/SDKs for Iotivity

== link:jni-c[jni-c]

This is a new Java API for Iotivity, written from scratch in 100% C11
(and Java), targeting the Iotivity C API.  It works with both the
official https://www.iotivity.org/[Iotivity] implementation (version
1.2.1) and https://github.com/iotk/iochibity[Iochibity], a fork of
Iotivity stripped of C++.  See link:jni-c/doc/Design.adoc[jni-c
Design Considerations] for a list of the goals of the project.


== link:jni-cxx[jni-cxx]

This is the legacy Java wrapper around the Iotivity C++ API, pulled
from the sources and slightly modified to work as a stand-alone
library that works with https://github.com/iotk/iochibity[Iochibity].

WARNING: Deprecated, sort of.  I probably won't do further work on this.
